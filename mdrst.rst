#################################
RST cheat sheet for Markdown fans
#################################

This cheatsheet provides a quick reference for translating
Markdown to ReStructured Text (RST) to help someone author or edit
RST files.

You can look at the `original Markdown file <md.md>`_ and the
`original RST file <rst.rst>`_ that the examples were culled from
to see the formatting as GitHub presents it.

   * - Code blocks
     - ::

          Look at this output:

          ```
          $ ls /usr/
          bin        lib        libexec    local      sbin       share
          ```

          Look at this code:

          ```python
          def fib(n):
              if n <= 2:
                  return 1
              else:
                  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
          ```

     - Notes


   * - Numbered
     - ::

          1. First ordered list item
          1. Another item
          1. Actual numbers don't matter

     - ::

          #. First ordered list item
          #. Another item
          #. Use hash marks for numbers

     -



   * - Bullets
     - ::

          * First unordered list item
          * Another item
          * And another item

          * First unordered list item
          * Another item
          * And another item

     -



   * - Nested
     - ::

          1. First outer

          RST needs blank lines around the inner list.

          The overlines and characters are flexible in RST as long as they are consistent.  RST requires strict nesting; even after the hierarchy is established, you can't use, say, a third-tier header right under a first-tier whereas MD allows this.
